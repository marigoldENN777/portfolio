## 🔹 AI-Assisted Development

For over one year, I have integrated AI into my daily development workflow.

My approach includes:

- Structured prompting  
- Debugging acceleration  
- Refactoring and code cleanup  
- Architecture planning and feature breakdown  

All generated code is manually reviewed.  
Architecture decisions and validation remain fully under my responsibility to ensure reliability and maintainability.

This workflow has significantly improved iteration speed and reduced debugging time.
